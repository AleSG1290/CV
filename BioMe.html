<p align="justify" class="ex1">I'm Aleyda Sierra-Gonzalez a wheat researcher from Mexico. I considere myself as a friendly, creative, passion, organize and
motivated human being enjoying everyday by trying to be the best version of myself and extract every possitive asspect of life + I am interested in understanding the science behing
 wheat physiology, genetics, cytogenetics and the use of wild wheat relatives.</p>

<p align="justify" class="ex1">Over the years I have adquired different skills that has allowed me to manage either Windows or iOS environments in which I am able to operate
all the Microsoft program suite and/or Open Sources programs. Taking advantage of my creativity I have become dexterous in graphic desing and
illustration, abilities that I try to employed on my daily basics, even building my own CV website (obviously with the help of <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a></p>

<h1>Nowadays</h1>
<p align="justify" class="ex1"> I'm a Research Fellow at The University of Nottingham/ <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/wrc/germplasm-resources/index.aspx">King's group</a>
 where I generate and characterize durum wheat material with alien introgression using molecular techniques: KASP markers, cytogenetic analysis: mcGISH and FISH and phenotypic data collected in
different environments: Mexico (CIMMYT), Morroco (ICARDA), India (IIWBR) and Malawi (LUANAR).

<h1>My PhD road</h1>
For my thesis entitled: "Genetic analysis of physiological traits to increase grain partitioning in high biomass cultivars in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)".
The format is in series of articles that will be submitted to high-impact journals. Each chapter will be composed of an introduction (including hypothesis for each 
specific section), material and methods, results, discussion and conclusions. <a href="http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/60157/">MY THESIS</a>
The framework includes seven chapters from which one will cover a wide range of themes wheat related (introduction), three
will be dedicated to explain physiological trait results obtained during seasons 2015-16 and 2016-17 from the HiBAP (experiment sown in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico)
and SxR DH (experiment sown in Suttong Bonnington, Loughborough, United Kindgdom) and as well for season 2017-18 a 'little' experiment with
12 cultivars was sown to tested high biomass genotypes under PGR conditions,
two chapters will report novel findings of the GWAS and QTL analysis and in the last chapter results from the overall
project will be reviewed.

 <h1>Hobbies + free time</h1>
<p align="justify" class="ex1">Besides trying to be an AWESOME wheat physiology genetic researcher ðŸ¤“ when I am not working, analyzing data, writing research
papers or reading related scientific articles I spend my time either learning how to use different OpenSource programs, as well also improve my coding skills (R, python, Java, etc) and as well
I like doing CrossFit and cooking. I have been doing CrossFit for around 4-5 years
(without trying to be a professional athlete!) as a way to relax and allow me to join in with a different community, plus
as a reward I'm getting fit!
<img src="./CrossFit.png" width="600px" class="center"></p>

<p align="justify" class="ex1">Cooking, cooking, cooking and more cooking! One day, I hope to open my own healthy food restaurant. I LOVE to re-invent recipes using
healthy ingredients or adjusting to my macro-nutritional needs and YES from time to time I cook DELICIOUS treatsðŸ¤¤

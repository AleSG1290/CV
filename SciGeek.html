<p align="justify" class="ex1">Strategies for achieving genetic gains in yield potential must combine enhanced above-ground dry
matter as well partitioning to the grain (harvest index). The present study aligned with NIFA-IWYP
(International Wheat Yield Partnership) project N-IWYP700* aimed to identify grain partitioning traits
that help maximize grain yield in high biomass backgrounds.
A High Biomass Association Panel (HiBAP) comprised of 150 spring wheat elite genotypes was
phenotyped in 2015-16 and 2016-17 at CIMMYT experimental station Norman E. Borlaug located in
NW Mexico. Physiological traits measured included biomass, plant length (height, spike, awns,
peduncle, internode 2 & 3), organ DM partitioning (spike, leaf lamina, true stem and leaf sheath) and
fruiting efficiency (# of grain set per unit spike dry weight) at anthesis (GS65) + 7 days and at harvest,
biomass, grain yield, yield components and harvest index was measured. BLUEs (Best Linear
Unbiased Estimators) from the cross-year analysis and molecular markers generated using the 35K
Wheat Breeders Axiom array were used to carry out a genome-wide association study (GWAS).
Novel marker-trait associations for the grain partitioning traits were identified mainly in chromosomes
5B and 6A; resulting in 13 at anthesis (e.g. LamPI, spike length) and 9 at harvest (e.g. HI, FE_GSP).
More detailed results will be presented and their potential application in breeding programs in markerassisted selection discussed.
*Results from harvest stage have already been reported by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/pbi.13052">Molero et al., 2019</a></p>

<p align="justify" class="ex1">To meet global wheat demands it is important to expand our current understanding of how physiological traits are
associated with genetic gains and to identify phenomic and genomic approaches to improve yield potential (Aisawi et al., 2015).
Yield is directly related to both biological yield (above-ground dry-matter per unit area; AGDM) and harvest index
(grain yield/AGDM; HI), but in recent years the rate of genetic progress in HI has not increased; indeed, there is
evidence for decreases in CIMMYT spring wheat modern cultivars as a result of a trade-off with increasing biomass
(Aisawi et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify new avenues for optimal dry matter (DM) partitioning of
assimilates in order to improve grain sink strength –grain number (GN)– and HI in high biomass backgrounds as well as
further identify genetic markers for these traits for application in marker-assisted selection.
A summary of the main DM partitioning data collected during 2015-16 of two different high biomass wheat varieties: spring
wheat panel HiBAP (High Biomass Association Panel, 150 genotypes) and winter wheat double haploid population RxS DH
(Rialto x Savannah Double Haploid, 89 genotypes) is presented and discussed. Results showed a strong association amongst
genotypes between grain yield and AGDM for both experiments, a trade-off between AGDM and HI on the spring wheat panel,
and an association between enhanced HI and reduced length of internode 3 at anthesis in the HiBAP and reduced length of internode 2
in RxS DH population.</p>

<p align="justify" class="ex1">While allocation of carbon to the developing wheat spike determines grain sink strength, concurrent growth of other plant organs (structural
and non-structural dry matter; DM) competes for carbon. This study observed genetic variation in structural and non-structural DM partitioning
to the true stem, leaf sheath and spike, and associations with spike growth, harvest index (HI), and grain yield in 26 CIMMYT cultivars and
advanced lines under high radiation, irrigated conditions in northwestern Mexico during 2011-12 and 2012-13. Structural DM partitioning was
assessed in the true-stem internodes and amongst the spike morphological components (rachis, glume, palea, lemma, awn) at harvest. Results
showed a positive association between spike partitioning index (spike DM/above ground DM at anthesis + 7 days; SPI) and HI. Lower true-stem
structural DM partitioning was associated with higher SPI and spike DM growth per unit area at anthesis + 7 days. There were negative
associations between SPI and spike DM per unit area and true-stem internode 2 and 3 DM partitioning, but no associations with other internodes.
A positive linear association was determined between each of rachis specific weight (rachis DM per unit length) and DM partitioning to the palea
and the fruiting efficiency (grains per unit spike DM at anthesis + 7 days). A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is ongoing to identify genetic
markers for these key target traits to enhance HI in the High Biomass Association panel at the field site in northwestern Mexico during 2015-16,
as part of the PhD of Aleyda Sierra-Gonzalez.

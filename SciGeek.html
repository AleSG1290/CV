Exploring genetic diversity for grain partitioning traits to enhance yield in a high biomass spring wheat panel ¦ 2021 ¦ FCR ¦ Research paper</a>
<p align="justify" class="ex1">Breeding to raise yield potential through enhancing photosynthesis will have limited impact unless harvest index 
    (HI: proportion of above-ground biomass as grain yield) is maintained or ideally increased. Boosting grain dry matter (DM) partitioning will 
    require increased allocation of assimilates to sink organs to enhance spike growth. A high biomass spring wheat panel of 150 genotypes encompassing elite, 
    landrace-derived and synthetic-derived lines was grown under yield potential conditions in two seasons in NW Mexico. Results showed that the incorporation 
    of landrace-derived and synthetic-derived backgrounds into elite lines resulted in higher expression of above-ground biomass (AGDM), 
    leaf lamina and stem DM partitioning at anthesis. However, no grain yield advantage was observed over elite lines, due to lower grain number per 
    unit area (GN) and decreased harvest index (HI). Positive linear associations were found among spike fertility-related traits-fruiting efficiency 
    (grains per unit of spike DM at anthesis; FE), GN and HI-which were, in turn, related positively with grain yield (GY). Stem-internode 3 length and 
    internode 3 DM partioning were negatively associated with spike partitioning index (SPI: ratio of spike DM to total above-ground DM at anthesis) and GN, 
    suggesting an enhanced competition for assimilates between the spike and stem internode 3 during stem elongation. Within-spike DM partitioning analysis 
    (glume, lemma, palea, rachis, awn) showed decreased partitioning to awns was associated with increased FE and thousand grain weight (TGW). While the use 
    of exotic material can enhance biomass, special attention needs to be paid in the selection for novel DM partitioning traits that raise HI and GN coming 
    from the elite genepool. The selection for grain partitioning traits in wheat breeding combined with sources expressing high biomass can potentially allow
    breeders to increase grain carbon assimilation that will deliver higher yields.

<p align="justify" class="ex1">Strategies for achieving genetic gains in yield potential must combine enhanced above-ground dry matter 
as well partitioning to the grain (harvest index: HI). The present study N-IWYP700 aimed to identify grain partitioning traits to 
maximize grain yield in high biomass backgrounds.
A High Biomass Association Panel (HiBAP) comprised of 150 diverse spring wheat elite lines, landrace and synthetic derived genotypes 
was phenotyped in 2015-16 and 2016-17 in NW Mexico. Physiological traits measured included biomass, plant length (height, spike, 
awns, peduncle, internode 2 & 3), organ dry matter (DM) partitioning (spike, leaf lamina, true stem and leaf sheath) and fruiting 
efficiency (grain set per unit spike DM; FE) at anthesis (GS65+7 days) and biomass, grain yield, yield components and HI at harvest. 
Cross-year field trials confirmed that the incorporation of landrace and synthetic background into elite lines resulted in a greater 
production of AGDM, radiation use efficiency, and grain weight (GW). However, no yield advantage was observed due to decreased HI 
and grain number per m2 (GN). The extra biomass was associated with higher lamina partitioning (LamPI) in landrace derived, and 
higher stem partitioning (StePI) in synthetic derived lines, resulting in both cases in less investment of DM in the spike (SPI). 
In this panel, SPI and FE were positively associated with HI and GN both, in turn, linearly related with grain yield. Higher SPI 
and HI were correlated with a shorter length of stem internode 2 (phytomer below peduncle) and reduced DM partitioning to stem 
internode 2. Detailed spike DM partitioning analysis at GS65+7d revealed that FE was associated with decreased awn DM partitioning 
and lower rachis DM partitioning with higher GW and grain yield. Therefore, selecting for these traits would contribute to 
maximizing SPI and FE and, therefore, HI and GN.
Using the 35K Wheat Breeders Axiom array for the generation of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and BLUEs (Best Linear 
Unbiased Estimators) from the cross-year analysis, a GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) was run. Novel marker-trait 
associations were identified for the grain partitioning traits at GS65+7d on chromosomes 5B (SPI), 6A (FESPI) and 7A 
(internode 3 length), and at harvest in 2B, 6B (HI), 2B, 3A (GN) and 5A, 6A, 7A (GY), explaining from 6-17% of the phenotypic 
variation. 
The implementation of these results can benefit breeding programs through the exploration of genetic resources achieving genetic 
gains that would increase yield potential.

<p align="justify" class="ex1">Strategies for achieving genetic gains in yield potential must combine enhanced above-ground dry

(International Wheat Yield Partnership) project N-IWYP700* aimed to identify grain partitioning traits
that help maximize grain yield in high biomass backgrounds.
A High Biomass Association Panel (HiBAP) comprised of 150 spring wheat elite genotypes was
phenotyped in 2015-16 and 2016-17 at CIMMYT experimental station Norman E. Borlaug located in
NW Mexico. Physiological traits measured included biomass, plant length (height, spike, awns,
peduncle, internode 2 & 3), organ DM partitioning (spike, leaf lamina, true stem and leaf sheath) and
fruiting efficiency (# of grain set per unit spike dry weight) at anthesis (GS65) + 7 days and at harvest,
biomass, grain yield, yield components and harvest index was measured. BLUEs (Best Linear
Unbiased Estimators) from the cross-year analysis and molecular markers generated using the 35K
Wheat Breeders Axiom array were used to carry out a genome-wide association study (GWAS).
Novel marker-trait associations for the grain partitioning traits were identified mainly in chromosomes
5B and 6A; resulting in 13 at anthesis (e.g. LamPI, spike length) and 9 at harvest (e.g. HI, FE_GSP).
More detailed results will be presented and their potential application in breeding programs in markerassisted selection discussed.

<p align="justify" class="ex1">To meet global wheat demands it is important to expand our current understanding of how physiological traits are
associated with genetic gains and to identify phenomic and genomic approaches to improve yield potential (Aisawi et al., 2015).
Yield is directly related to both biological yield (above-ground dry-matter per unit area; AGDM) and harvest index
(grain yield/AGDM; HI), but in recent years the rate of genetic progress in HI has not increased; indeed, there is
evidence for decreases in CIMMYT spring wheat modern cultivars as a result of a trade-off with increasing biomass
(Aisawi et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify new avenues for optimal dry matter (DM) partitioning of
assimilates in order to improve grain sink strength –grain number (GN)– and HI in high biomass backgrounds as well as
further identify genetic markers for these traits for application in marker-assisted selection.
A summary of the main DM partitioning data collected during 2015-16 of two different high biomass wheat varieties: spring
wheat panel HiBAP (High Biomass Association Panel, 150 genotypes) and winter wheat double haploid population RxS DH
(Rialto x Savannah Double Haploid, 89 genotypes) is presented and discussed. Results showed a strong association amongst
genotypes between grain yield and AGDM for both experiments, a trade-off between AGDM and HI on the spring wheat panel,
and an association between enhanced HI and reduced length of internode 3 at anthesis in the HiBAP and reduced length of internode 2
in RxS DH population.</p>

<p align="justify" class="ex1">While allocation of carbon to the developing wheat spike determines grain sink strength, concurrent growth of other plant organs (structural
and non-structural dry matter; DM) competes for carbon. This study observed genetic variation in structural and non-structural DM partitioning
to the true stem, leaf sheath and spike, and associations with spike growth, harvest index (HI), and grain yield in 26 CIMMYT cultivars and
advanced lines under high radiation, irrigated conditions in northwestern Mexico during 2011-12 and 2012-13. Structural DM partitioning was
assessed in the true-stem internodes and amongst the spike morphological components (rachis, glume, palea, lemma, awn) at harvest. Results
showed a positive association between spike partitioning index (spike DM/above ground DM at anthesis + 7 days; SPI) and HI. Lower true-stem
structural DM partitioning was associated with higher SPI and spike DM growth per unit area at anthesis + 7 days. There were negative
associations between SPI and spike DM per unit area and true-stem internode 2 and 3 DM partitioning, but no associations with other internodes.
A positive linear association was determined between each of rachis specific weight (rachis DM per unit length) and DM partitioning to the palea
and the fruiting efficiency (grains per unit spike DM at anthesis + 7 days). A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is ongoing to identify genetic
markers for these key target traits to enhance HI in the High Biomass Association panel at the field site in northwestern Mexico during 2015-16,
as part of the PhD of Aleyda Sierra-Gonzalez.
